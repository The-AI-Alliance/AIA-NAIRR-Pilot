The MOC allocates resources as needed to research projects from a pool of approximately 1000 servers with 30,000 cores.  Ceph storage of up to 50PB is available for project data.  The MOC is not certified for use with PII or HIPAA data.  Approximately 270 Nvidia GPUs (mostly A100SXM4s and H100s) and a small number of AMD MI210 accelerator graphics cards are available.  The MOC provides high-speed networking to public and research infrastructure, along with available external IP addresses as needed.   Details on usage pricing for various resources are available at https://nerc-project.github.io/nerc-docs/get-started/cost-billing/how-pricing-works/ . The resources provided to the NAIRR pilots will be allocated as usage credits, with a maximum quota specified for the credits.   Researchers may choose how to allocate their credits among resources.
