### Computing Resources
The MOC allocates resources as needed to research projects from a pool of approximately 1000 servers with 30,000 cores.  Ceph storage of up to 50PB is available for project data.    Approximately 270 Nvidia GPUs (mostly A100SXM4s and H100s) and a small number of AMD MI210 accelerator graphics cards are available.  The MOC provides high-speed networking to public and research infrastructure, along with available external IP addresses as needed.   Details on usage pricing for various resources are available [here](https://nerc-project.github.io/nerc-docs/get-started/cost-billing/how-pricing-works/). The resources provided to the NAIRR pilots will be allocated as usage credits, with a maximum quota specified for the credits.   Researchers may choose how to allocate their credits among resources.
