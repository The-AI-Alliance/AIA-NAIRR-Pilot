## Description 


### Core AI Projects 
* IBM Granite models (https://www.ibm.com/granite) are trained on 12T+ tokens of high-quality, curated data and open sourced with Apache 2.0 license.   They are designed for  
enterprise tasks supporting language (English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic, Czech, Italian, Korean, Dutch, and Chinese) and code (generation, explanation, docstring and pseudocode generation, unit test generation, code fixing)
* Instruct Lab (https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/ai/what-is-instructlab) is a methodology (with tool support) to enable collaborative model development.  This empowers non-technical experts to teach models about their domains and drives improved model performance at a fraction of the cost of pre-training. 
* Docling (https://github.com/docling-project/docling) is an efficient open-source toolkit for AI-driven document conversion from various formats (pdf, docx, xlsx, html, etc.)  to outputs in Markdown, HTML, and lossless JSON and integration with LLM frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.)
* Data Prep Kit ( https://github.com/data-prep-kit/data-prep-kit ) is an open-source toolkit that contains data preparation recipes for code and language modalities, aimed at fine-tuning, RAG, and instruct-tuning use cases that supports flexible computing from laptop to cluster scale.
*	Unitxt (https://github.com/IBM/unitxt) is an open-source Python library designed for enterprise-ready LLM evaluation, offering thousands of datasets, metrics, and built-in tools for creating custom benchmarks.
