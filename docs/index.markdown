## Overview 

[**The AI Alliance**](https://thealliance.ai/) is focused on fostering an open community and enabling developers and researchers to accelerate responsible innovation in AI while ensuring scientific rigor, trust, safety, security, diversity and economic competitiveness. We bring together a critical mass of compute, data, tools, and talent to accelerate and advocate for open innovation in AI.

**What is NAIRR Pilot?** The National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) is a vision for a shared national research infrastructure for responsible discovery and innovation in AI. Established by the National AI Initiative Act of 2020, the NAIRR Task Force was a federal advisory committee to 
* Investigate the feasibility and advisability of establishing and sustaining a National AI Research Resource 
* Propose a roadmap and implementation plan detailing how the resource should be established and sustained

In January 2023, the Task Force released a [detailed report](https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/NAIRR-TF-Presentations-01132023.pdf) on its findings and recommendations. The [NAIRR pilot](https://nairrpilot.org/) brings together computational, data, software, model, training and user support resources to demonstrate and investigate all major elements of the vision laid out by the NAIRR Task Force. Led by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) in partnership with other federal agencies and non-governmental partners, the pilot makes available government-funded, industry and other contributed resources in support of the nation's research and education community. The NAIRR pilot will run for two years, beginning January 24, 2024.  There is currently [a bill in the US Congress](https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr2385/BILLS-119hr2385ih.pdf) to establish NAIRR with its full intended scope.


**AI Alliance-NAIRR-Pilot Projects.**  Consistent with its mission,the AI Alliance has brought together three of its members, [Mass Open Cloud]( https://massopen.cloud/), [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) to participate in the NAIRR Pilot program.  The goals are to  
* **Provide computing resources and open-source AI assets to NAIRR pilot researchers and educators to advance science and education.**
* **Promote open collaboration in developing and deploying AI in society.** 

## Description of resources for NAIRR Pilot projects

### Mass Open Cloud
[Mass Open Cloud]( https://massopen.cloud/)  provides facilitation support for users and projects, with integration and development support for those who are new to AI/ML and kubernetes-style resource management.  The MOC operates a production Red Hat/OpenShift cloud and also provides bare-metal servers for research and development use. All operations software is open source, so experimenters can have access to the lowest levels of the software stack as needed.  Telemetry is also stored and provided to all researchers. Power consumption statistics for the infrastructure are also available on request for those who are researching sustainability.

### Red Hat AI open cloud software stack  
The software stak includes [RHEL-AI for experimentation](https://developers.redhat.com/learn/rhel-ai-try-llms-easy-way) and [OpenShift AI for enterprise application development](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/ai/openshift-ai). This environment provides tools across the full lifecycle of AI/ML experiments and models and helps build, train, test, and deploy models optimized for hybrid cloud environments.  

### IBM Research Open Source Tools & Models
There will be two tracks of submission for project proposals: **Track 1: Core AI Projects** and **Track 2: AI for Science Projects**. 
The assets for 'Core AI projects' track are described [here](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/AIA-NAIRR-Pilot/core-ai/) and the assets for the 'AI for Science' track are described [here](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/AIA-NAIRR-Pilot/ai4science/). In either track, **the proposal can have research or educational goals.**  The authors should explain how they would use **one or more** of the assets mentioned for either track to address their goal(s). Authors are encouraged to bring components from other open source libraries into their proposal for innnovative extensions.
